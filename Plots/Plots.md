# Plots Folder

This folder contains various plots generated from the data collected during the Power Manager Telemetry project. Below is an overview of the plots included:

## Plots Included
- **Battery Percentage vs Battery Voltage**: `BatteryPercantage_vs_BatteryVoltage.png`
- **CPU vs Battery**: `CPU_vs_Battery.png`
- **CPU vs System Power**: `CPU_vs_SystemPower.png`
- **Core Temperature vs CPU Package Power**: `CoreTemperature_vs_CPU Package Power.png`
- **CPU vs Battery (Duplicate)**: `Cpu_vs_battery (2).png`
- **Memory vs Battery**: `Memory_vs_Battery.png`
- **Memory vs Power**: `Memory_vs_Power.png`
- **NIC Power**: `NIC_Power.png`
- **System Power vs Battery**: `SystemPower_vs_Battery.png`
- **TDP**: `TDP.png`
- **Additional Plots**: Additional plots and insights can be found in `Plots.md` and other included files.

These plots are essential for visualizing how different conditions and settings affect the performance and power consumption of the system components at a 50% battery level. Refer to the main project [README.md](../README.md) for a comprehensive overview of the project and its objectives.
