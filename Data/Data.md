# Data Folder

This folder contains the telemetry data collected during the Power Manager Telemetry project. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

## Data Files
- **CSVs**: Compressed files containing power telemetry data collected from CPU, memory, NIC, and TDP at various system utilization percentages.
- **Power Consumption Logs**: Files documenting the power consumption measurements recorded over time.
- **System Utilization Reports**: Reports summarizing system utilization data during testing and analysis phases.

These data files are critical for analyzing power consumption patterns and evaluating the effectiveness of implemented solutions. Refer to the main project [README.md](../README.md) for a comprehensive overview of the project and its objectives.
