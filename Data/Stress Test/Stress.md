# Stress Test Folder

This folder contains data collected by stressing the CPU, Memory, and NIC at a constant 50% battery level. Below is an overview of the data included:

## Data Included
- **Normal Data at 50% Battery**: Baseline measurements of CPU, Memory, and NIC without any additional load or power-saving features enabled.
- **Data at 50% with Battery Saver On**: Measurements of CPU, Memory, and NIC with the battery saver feature enabled, capturing the impact of power-saving settings.
- **Data at 50% with Stress Test and Battery Saver Off**: Data collected under stress conditions with the battery saver feature turned off, providing insights into performance under load.
- **Data at 50% with Stress Test and Battery Saver On**: Data collected under stress conditions with the battery saver feature enabled, showing the effect of power-saving settings under load.

These datasets are essential for understanding how different conditions and settings affect the performance and power consumption of the system components at a 50% battery level. Refer to the main project [README.md](../README.md) for a comprehensive overview of the project and its objectives.
