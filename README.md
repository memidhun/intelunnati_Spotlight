## Problem Statement
In the era of 5G and edge computing, the deployment of devices across various locations has surged, leading to increased power consumption. The government is encouraging enterprises and industries to reduce power usage to achieve net-zero power consumption. Additionally, rising electricity costs make it crucial to understand the total power drawn by systems.

## Unique Idea Brief (Solution)
Our project aims to create a comprehensive telemetry system to monitor and manage power consumption across CPU, memory, NIC, and TDP. By utilizing open-source tools and creating a solution to run and utilize a system while gathering telemetry data, we can measure and analyze system power utilization based on system utilization percentage.

## Features Offered
- Collection of telemetry data from CPU, memory, NIC, and TDP.
- Measurement and recording of system power utilization for different components.
- Running traffic to achieve 100% system utilization using containers.
- Detailed reporting on power consumption issues, technical approaches, and results.

## Process Flow
1. * [x] **Research and Identification**: 
   - Identified and documented open-source tools for power measurement.
   - Documented available knobs in a system to measure power.

2. * [x] **Data Collection**:
   - Collected power telemetry data from CPU, memory, NIC, and TDP.
   
3. * [x] **Utilization Measurement**:
   - Measured and recorded system power utilization for CPU, NIC, and TDP based on system utilization percentage.
   
4. * [x] **Traffic Simulation**:
   - Ran traffic to consume 100% system utilization using containers.
   
5. * [x] **Solution Implementation**:
   - Created a solution to run and utilize a system while collecting telemetry data.
   
6. * [x] **Reporting**:
   - Compiled a detailed report on the power problem, technical approach, and results.
